# Blockchain Consensuses Comparison

## Motivation
Each month at least 1 new consensus is being introduced to comunity. There are a lot of reviews and analysises, but all of them do use not one methodology. It is difficult to compare consensuses without structured approache. I am proposing my vision (and of course comparison) how to analyse different consensuses.
